Finally got pandas to work
Imported the map of melboune and made it shrink to fit the city of yara
Made a few other graphs as well

Update:
Imported some other data, but it wasn;t in CSV or any other readable format, so I had to manually code it in as a list, luckly there wasn't a lot of data

Update: Changed the colours on the map, aparently I can also change the shape of the dots(location) as well, will look into it before the final presentation.
