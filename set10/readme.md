Got the Rise presentation, will contiue to work on the data project

Update 1:
Rise doens't work? Can't seem to edit the presentation as shown in Bens recorded video, asking chat gpt for help didn't work

Update 2:
Codespace has decided to be a bitch several of my graphs were working as intended this morning, after lunch without touching the code once I represhed it and their seems to be an issue in the graphs legend?
Lots of additional code but it doesn't effect the presentation that much, will edit it when all the other parts are complete.

Update: Spent a long time trying to fix it to no avail, chat gpt gave solutions but none were working? Seems to be a problem with the text format?
